Choline is an essential brain nutrient, which babies get from their mothers during pregnancy and through breast milk. Many women, however, do not have a sufficient supply of this vital nutrient to pass along to their child. The suggested adequate intake for women is 425 mg per day. Choline can be obtained from foods such as beef, pork, eggs, chicken liver, and dried soybeans.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><b>Choline: Critical role during fetal development and dietary requirements in adultsZeisel SH.

It begins in childhood and often continues into adulthood. The exact cause is not known, but may come from a combination of several factors such as: genetics, nutritional deficiencies, food allergies and intolerances, sensitivity to environmental chemicals, and exposure to toxins. This paper looks at the critical role of nutritional deficiencies and the need for supplementation with vitamins and minerals, omega 3/6 fatty acids, DHA, and phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) to treat inattention, focus, and concentration problems in order for children to lead a normal and productive life.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; text-align: inherit;"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; text-align: inherit;"><b>The Oxford-Durham study: A randomized, controlled trial of dietary supplementation with fatty acids in childrenRichardson, AJ and Montgomery P.

Newborns consume colostrum as their first complete food, and it plays a vital role in helping their immature immune systems adapt to a new environment. Bovine colustrom is similar to human colostrum and when used as a supplement has many of the same beneficial effects. Colostrum can help to balance and support the adult immune system. It has anti-microbial properties to protect the body from all kinds of pathogens.
