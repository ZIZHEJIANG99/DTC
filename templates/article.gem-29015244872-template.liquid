We watch with delight, but also maybe with a little fear, as our pregnancy bellies expand to accommodate baby during pregnancy. Over nine months, the uterus will slowly expand to 1,000 times its original size, and as it grows so does the belly which becomes firm and distends to create the baby bump. We stare in awe at our ever growing baby bump, but once baby arrives many moms are sometimes unpleasantly surprised at the look of their belly after baby.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The reality is your body just grew another human being and that is amazing.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>And to be able to do its job, your body, especially the belly, had to make some significant changes. Try not to worry too much about your belly after baby and remember it is normal to have a post baby pouch for many months. It took you nine months to have the baby so be patient and give your body, and your stomach, the time it needs to recover.
